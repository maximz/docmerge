Command-line tool to combine Word documents. Major WIP!

### Proposed Features

* Append one Word document to another, with no break, a page break, a section break, or both in between.
* Chain appends into one command
* Choose whether to preserve header/footer and styles of a particular document or instead maintain each individual document's formatting
